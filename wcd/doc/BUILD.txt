This file explains how to compile wcd for DOS and Windows
with compilers other than GNU GCC.

To compile wcd with GCC (DJGPP, MINGW, CYGWIN) see BUILDGCC.txt

For Unix/Linux compile instructions see file UNIX.txt.

For how to install the program on DOS/Windows see file DOS.txt.


----------------------------------------------
PDCurses
----------------------------------------------

To build wcd with PDCurses interface you need to have the PDCurses
library installed. Get PDCurses at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdcurses/
Compile it and copy the library file into the \lib directory of your
compiler and the curses.h file in the \include directory.

To get support for the original console colours for the windows 32 bit
version you need PDCurses 2.7.

I reported the following bug on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdcurses/
*  Bug 1144353: Scroll out of window when screen buffer is large (Windows)
This bug is solved in PDCurses 2.7.

----------------------------------------------
DOS 16 bit
----------------------------------------------

Wcd 16 bit can be build with Borland and Watcom compiler.
Borland C compiler version 3.1 and 4.0 work (I always use 4.0).
A free version of Borland 2.01 can be downloaded at http://community.borland.com/museum/
Watcom C compiler is freely available at http://www.openwatcom.org/

BORLAND

    Go to directory dos16.

    To compile wcd with default conio interface type (Compact memory model):

    >  make

    To compile wcd with default conio interface type (Large memory model):

    >  make -f wcd.mak

    or open wcd.prj file in Borland 3.1 IDE.


    To compile wcd with PDCurses interface type (Large memory model):

    >  make -f pdcurses.mak


WATCOM

    Go to directory dos16/watcom


    To compile wcd with standard out interface type (Large memory model):

    >  wmake

    To compile wcd with PDCurses interface type (Large memory model):

    >  wmake -f pdcurses.mak


----------------------------------------------
DOS 32 bit
----------------------------------------------

WATCOM

    Watcom C compiler is freely available at http://www.openwatcom.org/

    Go to directory dos32/watcom.

    To compile wcd with default standard out interface type:

    >  wmake

    To compile wcd with PDCurses interface type:

    >  wmake -f pdcurses.mak

----------------------------------------------
DOS 32 bit for BASH
----------------------------------------------

Go to directory dos32bsh and use the same commands as with the
normal dos 32 bit version.

----------------------------------------------
Windows 32 bit console version.
----------------------------------------------

This version can be compiled with free compilers:
Borland C++: http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html
LCC        : http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/
Watcom     : http://www.openwatcom.org/

Go to directory win32.
Cd to one of the compiler directories: borland, lcc or watcom.

The makefiles that use PDCurses (pdcurses.mak) assume that curses.h has been
copied into the include directory of the compiler and the pdcurses library in
the compiler's lib directory.

BORLAND

    Edit the makefile you want to use first: set CC_HOME to the correct value.

    The default makefile (makefile) compiles wcd with stdout interface.

    > make

    To compile wcd with curses interface type:

    > make -f pdcurses.mak

    To compile wcd with conio interface type:

    >  make -f conio.mak

WATCOM

    The default makefile (makefile) compiles wcd with stdout interface.

    > wmake

    To compile wcd with curses interface type:

    > wmake -f pdcurses.mak

LCC

    Because LCC make doesn't support an 'include' directive we
    have to use GNU make. You can get GNU make for Windows from
    the GnuWin32 project or the MinGW project.

    GnuWin32: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
    MinGW:    http://www.mingw.org/   Get mingw32-make (not msys-make)

    Copy the GNU make executable to "gmake.exe" somewhere in PATH.

    To compile wcd with stdout interface:

    > gmake

    To compile wcd with curses interface:

    > gmake CURSES=1

    To compile wcd with conio interface:

    > gmake CONIO=1

    Conio version compiled with LCC does not work properly.
    Preferably compile stdout or pdcurses version.

----------------------------------------------
Windows 32 bit MSYS and zsh version.
----------------------------------------------

Go to directory win32zsh.
Same as win 32 console version.
