Contact Erwin Waterlander if you want to help (waterlan@xs4all.nl). Programming
skills are not required. I will send you a language file that you can use to
translate.

Technical information.
======================
If you want to create a language file yourself see information below.


Starting with release 4.0.0 wcd uses the translation package "GNU gettext".

Information about gettext and a manual can be found at:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html


Prerequisites.
==============

Get the wcd source package.

To add a new language you need to have the gettext tools installed on your
system.

Linux:
Gettext is available on almost all Linux distributions.

Windows:
The best way to use gettext on Windows is in the Cygwin environment.
See http://cygwin.com/
You can get also a ready-to-run native Windows gettext package from the
GnuWin32 project at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/

DOS:
The DJGPP project has a gettext package, but it is quite old.

Add a new language.
===================

Change to the sub directory 'po' in the wcd source directory. Set the LANG
environment variable to your local language. Type 'msginit' to create an
initial .po file of your language.


Update existing language file.
==============================

Edit the .po file in the 'po' subdirectory. Go back to the source directory and
type 'make mofiles'. This will convert the .po file in a .mo file.
