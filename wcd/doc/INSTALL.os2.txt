Install wcd with internationalization support.


Package directory structure
===========================

When you unpack the zip archive you will get the following
directory structure:

bin/                             Binary
share/doc/                       Documentation
share/locale/                    Locale directory
share/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/     Locale directory with Dutch Language file
share/man/man1/                  Man page


Unzip the package in a directory which we will call PREFIX.

Zip packages have been created with a default PREFIX: c:\usr

You can install wcd in a different PREFIX directory if you want.

Add directory PREFIX/bin to your PATH environment variable.


Language selection
==================

See section LOCALIZATION of the wcd manual.

======================================================================
= OS/2 installation                                                  =
======================================================================

Notice that under OS/2 console an os2-program cannot change the current
work directory.	That is why wcd generates a command script (wcdgo.cmd)
which must be executed in the current shell.

The script wcd.cmd first executes wcdos2.exe, which creates the wcdgo.cmd
script. Then wcd.cmd executes the wcdgo.cmd script.


- Use of environment variable HOME / WCDHOME

The OS/2 versions of wcd can make use of environment variable HOME.
(UNIX version always uses HOME.)

Example:
set HOME=c:\home\waterlan

If HOME is set, wcd will place all it's files (treedata.wcd, extra.wcd,
alias.wcd, ban.wcd, wcd.go) in directory %HOME% .
The behaviour of wcd is then equal to the UNIX version of wcd.
Wcd will scan the disk default from %HOME%. Drives will not
be automaticly scanned by changing to them.
You need to tell wcd explicitly. E.g.:

wcd -S c: -A d: -A e:

Matching of directories is now global over all scanned drives.

If the environment variable WCDHOME is set wcd will use
WCDHOME instead of HOME.
