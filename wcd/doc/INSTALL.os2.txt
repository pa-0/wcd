Install wcd with internationalization support.


Package directory structure
---------------------------

When you unpack the zip archive you will get the following
directory structure:

bin/                             Binary
share/doc/                       Documentation
share/locale/                    Locale directory
share/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/     Locale directory with Dutch Language file
share/man/man1/                  Man page


Unzip the package in a directory which we will call PREFIX.

Zip packages have been created with a default PREFIX: c:\usr

You can install wcd in a different PREFIX directory if you want.

Add directory PREFIX/bin to your PATH environment variable.
