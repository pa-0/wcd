Package directory structure
===========================

When you unpack the zip archive you will get the following
directory structure:

bin/                             Binary
share/doc/                       Documentation
share/locale/                    Locale directory
share/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/     Locale directory with Dutch Language file
share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/     Locale directory with Spanish Language file
share/man/man1/                  Man page

If wcd was build without Native Language support the share/locale
folder is missing.

Unzip the package in a directory which we will call PREFIX.

Zip packages have been created with a default PREFIX:

dos32    : c:/djgpp
dos32bsh : c:/djgpp
win32    : c:/usr/local
win32psh : c:/usr/local
win32zsh : c:/usr/local
cygwin   : /usr

You can install wcd in a different PREFIX directory if you want.

Add directory PREFIX/bin to your PATH environment variable.


Language selection
==================

See section LOCALIZATION of the wcd manual.

The WIN32 version of wcd automatically detects the language and can find the
LOCALEDIR if wcd was unpacked in a different PREFIX directory.

======================================================================

- dos 16 bit version:

 Make sure that wcd.exe is in your path.

 The dos 16 bit version of wcd has no internationalization support.

......................................................................

- dos 32 bit version:

 Make sure that wcd.exe and cwsdpmi.exe are in your path.
 (requires 80386 CPU or higher)

......................................................................

- dos Bourne Again Shell (bash):


 Add the following function to your ~/_bashrc
 file. Notice that under Windows 95/NT the ~/.bashrc
 file overrides the ~/_bashrc file. In that case place
 the function in ~/.bashrc

function wcd
{
   PREFIX/bin/wcdbash.exe $*
   . c:/wcd.go
}

Replace PREFIX with the prefix used during package installation.
Start a new bash

Attention!
wcd 2.1 and later writes the wcd.go file now always on drive C: unless
other specified with the -d option.

If you use environment variable HOME make a function like this:

function wcd
{
   PREFIX/bin/wcdbash.exe $*
   . $HOME/wcd.go
}

......................................................................
- Long directory name support

The 32 bit DOS versions for DOS supports long directory names
in a Windows 95/98 Dos-box.

Wcd makes use of DJGPP's LFN (long filename) API, which works under
Windows 95, 98 an ME. LFN support does not work if you started your PC
in MS-DOS mode.

LFN support can be controlled with the environment variable LFN.

set LFN=y  enables LFN support.
set LFN=n  disables LFN support.

If variable LFN is not set, LFN is by default enabled.

Notice that you need to have set LFN=y in your DJGPP.ENV file
if you have the DJGPP compiler installed.

...

Current DOS version of Wcd does not support LFN under Windows NT.

If you need LFN support under Windows NT use the win32 console
version of wcd.

......................................................................
- Using default options

If you want to use some options by default use an alias or macro to do that.
Smarter shells like 4DOS and NDOS are able to set aliases like this:
alias wcd=wcd.exe -Q

In DOS BASH add the options in your function.

In the MS-DOS COMMAND.COM shell you can use the 'doskey' command to define
a macro. You could add the following line to you AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
doskey wcd=wcd.exe -Q $*

......................................................................
- Use of environment variable HOME / WCDHOME

The DOS versions of wcd can make use of environment variable HOME.
(UNIX version always uses HOME.)

set HOME=c:/home/waterlan

If HOME is set, wcd will place all it's files (treedata.wcd, extra.wcd,
alias.wcd, ban.wcd, wcd.go) in directory %HOME% .
The behaviour of wcd is then equal to the UNIX version of wcd.
Wcd will scan the disk default from %HOME%. Drives will not
be automaticly scanned by changing to them.
You need to tell wcd explicitly. E.g.:

wcd -S c: -A d: -A e:

Matching of directories is now global over all scanned drives.

...

If HOME is set, DJGPP bash will read '_bashrc' from %HOME%.
Your wcd function could now look like:

function wcd
{
   PREFIX/bin/wcd.exe $*
   . $HOME/wcd.go
}

If the environment variable WCDHOME is set wcd will use
WCDHOME instead of HOME.


======================================================================
= 2 Windows NT console (Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/7) installation            =
======================================================================

- Win32 console

Notice that under Windows NT console (MS-DOS prompt) a win32-program cannot
change the current work directory (although a DOS-program can on NT4).
That is why wcd generates a batch script (c:\wcdgo.bat or %HOME%\wcdgo.bat)
which must be executed in the current shell.

To be sure that you execute the correct 'wcd.bat' you could
optionally create a macro for wcd:

 doskey wcd=c:\bin\wcd.bat $*


Notice that environment variable WCDHOME overrides HOME.

......................................................................
- Windows VISTA/7

In a Windows VISTA/7 command prompt you may have limited access to directories.
To get access to more directories you need adminstrator rights. You can get
a command prompt with administrator rights if you right click on the command
prompt icon and select `Run as administrator'.

......................................................................
- Windows PowerShell

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell

It  is  required that environment variable HOME or WCDHOME is set.  A function
in your PowerShell user profile must be defined. The location of this profile
is stored in the $profile variable.

function wcd
{
  PREFIX\bin\wcdwin32psh.exe $args
  & $env:HOME\wcdgo.ps1
}

Replace PREFIX with the prefix used during package installation.
Start a new PowerShell


......................................................................
- MSYS (bash) and Z shell (zsh)

MSYS, a contraction of "Minimal SYStem", is a Bourne Shell command line
interpreter system. Offered as an alternative to Microsoft's cmd.exe, this
provides a general purpose command line environment, which is particularly
suited to use with MinGW, for porting of many Open Source applications to the
MS-Windows platform. See also http://www.mingw.org/


A native win32 port of Z shell has been made by Amol Deshpande.
Download from http://www.xs4all.nl/~waterlan/


It  is  required that environment variable HOME or WCDHOME is set.  A function
must be defined like this:


function wcd
{
   PREFIX/bin/wcdwin32zsh.exe $*
   . $HOME/wcd.go
}

MSYS bash: put this function e.g. in $HOME/.bashrc
Z Shell  : put this function e.g. in $HOME/.zshenv

Replace PREFIX with the prefix used during package installation.


You have to start MSYS like this: msys.bat --norxvt , because the default rxvt
terminal doesn't accept standard input from native win32 programs. See also
http://www.nabble.com/Accepting-standard-input-from-MSYS-with-native-Win32-programs-td19432889.html
You need a recent version of msys.bat that supports option --norxvt.

......................................................................

- UNC support

UNC stands for Universal Naming Convention.
It is a Windows 9x/NT way of accessing network drives without
using a drive letter.
It's from Windows SMB LAN manager networking.
A UNC path looks like: \\servername\sharename

In Windows networking, you can map a drive letter to a UNC:
  net use G: \\gui_fileserv\apps

The win32 console version of wcd supports UNC paths since version 3.1.0.
To change to the UNC path wcd makes use of the 'pushd' command in the
wcdgo.bat script.

Quote from John Savill's Windows NT/2000 FAQ (http://www.windows2000faq.com):

"The 'pushd' command automatically maps a drive and navigates to it. If you
run the 'net use' command after you run pushd, you'll see a new drive mapping.
After you're done working in the UNC location, use the 'popd' command to
navigate back to your original network location before you ran 'pushd'."

Options -S, -A and -E can also work on servernames. For instance:

  wcd -S \\servername

will search for shared directories on the server and scan them all.


The Windows PowerShell and MSYS/ZSH version of wcd have full support of UNC paths.
One can change directly to UNC paths, without mapping to a drive letter.

======================================================================


1)
Make sure that environment variable HOME is set.


2)

 Add the following function to your ~/.bashrc file.

function wcd
{
   PREFIX/bin/wcd.exe $*
   . $HOME/bin/wcd.go
}

Replace PREFIX with the prefix used during package installation.
Start a new bash

......................................................................

The Cygwin version behaves exactly as the Unix version of wcd.

o) regards case by default.
   - Use option -i to ignore case.
o) does not use drive letters.
o) Uses the same filenames for treedata files etc.

UNC paths are fully supported.
