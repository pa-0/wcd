1.0 History

        In 1995 I started working for Philips Research in Eindhoven. I
        had to do all my work on HP Unix (HP-UX). I was missing an
        application like Norton Change Directory (NCD). I didn't know
        of any other NCD like program so in 1996 I decided to make it
        myself. On the internet I found Jason Mathew's DOSDIR package
        in the Simtel archives. DOSDIR was my starting point. Because
        DOSDIR was portable I could make wcd at home with Borland-C
        3.1 on my PC (intel 80486, 80 MHz) on DOS 6.2. I mailed the
        source code to work and there I build a version for HP-UX. I
        made wcd for myself, but was happy to share it with others.
        Some colleagues started using wcd.

        In 1997, I found the DJGPP compiler and used that as my main
        development environment. Now I was able to create a 32 bit DOS
        version, and it supported long directory names under Windows
        95.

        In Dec 1997 I put wcd on the internet. I was amazed that
        already 7 people downloaded it in the first month. From then
        on development was driven a lot by feedback I got via the
        internet. In March 1998 the GNU distribution license was
        attached to version 2.0.0.

        Later I installed Linux (RedHat 5.0) on my PC at home and
        that became my main development platform.

        Because eventually most DOS users will migrate to Windows I
        ported wcd to Windows NT. I started with Borland C 4.0, but
        changed soon to the MinGW compiler. The first Win32 port was
        ready in November 1999.
        The DOS 32 bit version still stayed the most popular version for
        a long time. In 2003 the Windows NT port became most popular.

        In April 2000 (version 2.3.0) a curses based interface was added
        to have a consistent interface on all platforms. And a year later
        the 'graphical tree' curses interface was added (version 3.0.0).

        I used wcd mainly in an ASCII (C) environment. Only since version 3.2.0
        in Dec 2005 eight bit characters sets were properly supported.

        After a development pause of two years, version 4.0.0 (Sep 2008) was
        the first which supported internationalization by message translations
        via gettext.

        Since version 5.0.0 (Mar 2009) wcd supports Unicode, to enable
        internationalization for all languages. In the beginning this
        development was done on Linux, and later on Cygwin which supports
        Unicode since version 1.7.

        In version 6.0.0 (Feb 2017) the DOSDIR directory interface layer was
        removed from Wcd.  The amount of directories can be huge these days,
        so scanning a disk can take a long time. Removal of DOSDIR resulted in
        faster disk scanning on Windows and Unix.

    2.1 C3PO data structures

        Data structures with dynamic memory allocation were created
        with Ondrej Popp's C3PO ( Compiler Compiler Compiler Popp
        Ondrej ).

        http://sourceforge.net/projects/c3po/
        email: <ondrejpopp@users.sourceforge.net>

    2.2 DOSDIR

        Wcd used DOSDIR for scanning the disk until Wcd version 5.3.4. Only
        the parts of DOSDIR that are distributed under GNU General Public
        License were used in WCD.

        DOSDIR: A Portable DOS/UNIX/VMS Directory Interface

        DOSDIR minimizes the OS-specific directory access code for
        applications allowing programmers to concentrate on the
        application itself and not on the low-level directory and file
        structure. DOSDIR applications will run on their native
        operating systems with the appropriate file syntax and
        handling, which is expected for that platform.

    2.3 Recmatch

        I used the regular matching algorithm, recmatch(), of
        Info-Zip's unzip program.

        recmatch() was written by Mark Adler.

    2.5 Miscellaneous bits and pieces

        wcd_fixpath() is a modified version of _fixpath() Copyright
        (C) 1995-1996 DJ Delorie, see COPYING.DJ for details

        _fixpath() is a library function of libc for DJGPP. See also
        http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/

        Source code to scan Windows LAN was originally written and
        placed in the Public Domain by Felix Kasza. Copied from Felix
        Kasza's Win32 Samples page at MVPS.ORG.
        http://www.mvps.org/win32/

        Source code for colours in curses interface was copied from
        the PDCurses demo program 'tui'. The 'tui' demo program was
        originally written by P.J. Kunst and placed in the Public
        Domain.

        Markus Kuhn's free wcwidth() and wcwidth_cjk() implementation is used.
