Known problems
==============

1  Unix and DOS 32 bit version:
   - Strange behaviour when the argument has a wildcard and matches a
     file or directory in the current directory.

  This is the result of the pathname expansion of the shell.
  The work-around is to "double quote" the argument (in some shells).


2 Option -rmtree doesn't remove directories.
  This only happens with the Windows console and zsh version if
  it is compiled with Borland 5.x. The problem is not there when
  wcd is compiled with any other compiler.


3 Garbage printed on screen after exit.
  Occurs in Windows NT/2000/XP console with large buffer
  with wcd for win32 when PDC_RESTORE_SCREEN is set.
  Windows only allows a relatively small buffer size to save.

4 `gmake install' may fail on Windows or OS/2.

 When you build wcd on Windows without the MSYS environment you may run into
 problems during `make install', because the GnuWin32 ports of `mkdir' and
 `install' of the coreutils package have problems. See
 http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2115584&group_id=23617&atid=379173
 Better use the MSYS environment.

 This problem is also seen on OS/2. Try an older version of coreutils package.

If you think you found a bug do the following.
First check that you have the latest version of WCD. The bug
may already have been solved.
If it has not been solved than send me an e-mail.
Describe the bug and tell me
what version of WCD you use and under what operating system.

Also ideas to improve wcd are welcome.
