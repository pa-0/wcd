Known problems
==============

1 Unix shells (bash, ksh, sh, csh):
  Strange behaviour when the argument has a wildcard and matches a
  file or directory in the current directory.

  This is the result of the filename expansion of the shell.
  The work-around is to 'single quote' the argument.

2 Option -rmtree doesn't remove directories.
  This only happens with Windows versions
  when wcd has been build with Borland 5.x. The problem is not
  there when wcd has been build with any other compiler.

3 Garbage printed on screen after exit.
  Occurs in Windows NT/2000/XP console with large buffer
  with wcd for win32 when PDC_RESTORE_SCREEN is set.
  Windows only allows a relatively small buffer size to save.

4 `gmake install' may fail on Windows or OS/2.

  When you build wcd on Windows without the MSYS environment you may run into
  problems during `make install', because the GnuWin32 ports of `mkdir' and
  `install' of the coreutils package have problems. See
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2115584&group_id=23617&atid=379173
  Better use the MSYS environment.

 This problem is also seen on OS/2. Try an older version of coreutils package.

5 A DOS 32 bit version built with OpenWatcom C stops scanning the disk when it
  encounters on a Windows drive a path longer than 66 characters. The problem is that
  after chdir() fails to change to a path longer than 66 characters, getcwd() returns
  a wrong path, namely the path chdir() could not change to chopped at 66 characters. I
  think this is a bug in OpenWatcom. getcwd() should return the path of the last
  successful chdir(). This was seen on Windows Vista 32 bit.

If you think you found a bug do the following.
First check that you have the latest version of WCD. The bug
may already have been solved. If it has not been solved than
send me an e-mail <waterlan@xs4all.nl>. Describe the bug and
tell me what version of WCD you use and under what operating
system.

Also ideas to improve wcd are welcome.
