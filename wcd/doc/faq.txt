sh/bash/zsh/csh:

Q: I have installed wcd. It looks like it works, but the
   directory is actually not changed.

A: The directory can only be changed by the shell builtin cd
   command. You need to define a wcd function or alias.
   See the manual or the installation documentation.

bash:

Q: I have wcd.exe installed and defined the function
   in ~/.bashrc but the shell returns: "command not found".

A: The problem is that ~/.bashrc is not executed because
   the bash is started as an interactive login shell.
   The bash only executes the commands in ~/.bashrc if it
   is started as an interactive shell that is not a login
   shell.
   If the bash is started as an interactive login shell it
   first reads and executes commands from the file
   /etc/profile, if that file  exists. After  reading  that
   file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and
   ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands
   from the first one that exists and is readable.
   The solution is to define the wcd function in one of these
   files.

Windows

Q: How do I automatically start the explorer after wcd?

A: If you use the DOS 32 bit version on windows 95/98/ME this batch script will work:

   @echo off
   wcd.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6
   explorer.exe .

   If you use the win32 console version add an extra line to your wcd.bat
   script (on windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/7).

   @echo off
   wcdwin32.exe %*
   echo explorer.exe . >> c:\wcdgo.bat
   c:\wcdgo.bat

Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/7

Q: The system administrator has set environment variable HOME,
   but I want the behaviour of wcd as if HOME and WCDHOME were
   not set (as I was used to on DOS/Windows 9x).

A: In the wcd.bat file you have to copy HOME into another
   variable, unset HOME, run wcd, and copy HOME back to its original
   value.  An example follows:

   @echo off
   set HOMETEMP=%HOME%
   set HOME=
   wcdwin32.exe %*
   set HOME=%HOMETEMP%
   c:\wcdgo.bat

   You may need to rescan your drives after this.
