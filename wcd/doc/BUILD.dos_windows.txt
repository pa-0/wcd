This file explains how to compile wcd for DOS and Windows.

To compile wcd with internationalization support see BUILD.dos_windows.intl.txt

For Unix compile instructions see file INSTALL.unix.txt.

For how to install the program see files INSTALL.dos_windows.txt.


----------------------------------------------
PDCurses
----------------------------------------------

To build wcd with PDCurses interface you need to have the PDCurses
library installed. Get PDCurses at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdcurses/
Compile it and copy the library file into the \lib directory of your
compiler and the curses.h file in the \include directory.

To get support for the original console colours for the windows 32 bit
version you need PDCurses 2.7.

I reported the following bug on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdcurses/
*  Bug 1144353: Scroll out of window when screen buffer is large (Windows)
This bug is solved in PDCurses 2.7.

----------------------------------------------
DOS 16 bit
----------------------------------------------

Wcd 16 bit can be build with Borland and Watcom compiler.
Borland C compiler version 3.1 and 4.0 work (I always use 4.0).
A free version of Borland 2.01 can be downloaded at http://community.borland.com/museum/
Watcom C compiler is freely available at http://www.openwatcom.org/

--- Borland ---

Go to directory dos16.

To compile wcd with default conio interface type (Compact memory model):

>  make

To compile wcd with default conio interface type (Large memory model):

>  make -f wcd.mak

or open wcd.prj file in Borland 3.1 IDE.


To compile wcd with PDCurses interface type (Large memory model):

>  make -f pdcurses.mak


--- Watcom ---

Go to directory dos16/watcom


To compile wcd with standard out interface type (Large memory model):

>  wmake

To compile wcd with PDCurses interface type (Large memory model):

>  wmake -f pdcurses.mak


----------------------------------------------
DOS 32 bit
----------------------------------------------

Go to directory dos32. The 32 bit version is compiled with DJGPP.
DJGPP is a free C++ compiler. You can download it at http://www.delorie.com/
A 32 bit DOS version can also be build with Watcom C compiler.
Watcom C compiler is freely available at http://www.openwatcom.org/

DJGPP supports long file and directory names under windows 95/98/ME,
Watcom not.


--- DJGPP ---

Go to directory dos32.

To compile wcd with default conio interface type:

>  make -f conio.mak

To compile wcd with PDCurses interface type:

>  make -f pdcurses.mak


--- Watcom C ---

Go to directory dos32/watcom.

To compile wcd with default standard out interface type:

>  wmake

To compile wcd with PDCurses interface type:

>  wmake -f pdcurses.mak

----------------------------------------------
DOS 32 bit for BASH
----------------------------------------------

Use the DJGPP compiler.

Go to directory dos32bsh and use the same commands as with the
normal dos 32 bit version.

----------------------------------------------
Windows 32 bit console version.
----------------------------------------------

This version can be compiled with free compilers:
Borland C++: http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html
MinGW      : http://www.mingw.org/
LCC        : http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/
Watcom     : http://www.openwatcom.org/

Go to directory win32.
Cd to one of the compiler directories: borland, lcc, mingw or watcom.

Edit the makefile you want to use first: set CC_HOME to the correct value.

The default makefile (makefile) compiles wcd with stdout interface.

> make

The makefiles that use PDCurses (pdcurses.mak) assume that pdcurses.h has been
copied into the include directory of the compiler and the pdcurses library in
the compiler's lib directory.

> make -f pdcurses.mak

To compile wcd with conio interface type:

>  make -f conio.mak

Conio version compiled with LCC does not work properly.
Preferably compile stdout or pdcurses version.

----------------------------------------------
Windows 32 bit MSYS and zsh version.
----------------------------------------------

Go to directory win32zsh.
Same as win 32 console version.

----------------------------------------------
Cygwin version.
----------------------------------------------

Cygwin can be obtained from http://cygwin.com/

Go to directory cygwin.

To compile wcd with stdout interface:

$ make -f stdout.mak

To compile wcd with PDCurses interface:

$ make -f pdcurses.mak

To compile wcd with NCurses interface:

$ make -f ncurses.mak
