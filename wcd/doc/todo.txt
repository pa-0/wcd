TO DO
=====

* Translations.

  Translate wcd into more languages. Contact Erwin Waterlander
  if you want to help (waterlan@xs4all.nl). Programming skills
  are not required.


* Unicode matching with normalization.
  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_normalization


* Matching with locale support.

  For instance an `e' should also match an `e' with accent.


* Support scripts that write from right to left like Arabic or Hebrew.



I always kept this in mind while developing wcd:
* keep it simple.
  Although wcd has many features it should still be usable by by novice users.
* wcd is a directory changer.
  The main goal is to change directory with a minimal amount of keystrokes.
  Don't change wcd into a directory/file manager.
* low requirements.
  A minimal wcd version can be build with just an ansi-C compiler. For
  instance the graphical tree is drawn with ascii characters and colours
  are not required. This way wcd runs also on very old systems.


NOT TO DO
=========

Things I deliberately not implemented. (This may change in the future.)

* Extended regular expressions support.

  Full regular expressions are too powerful for file and directory name
  matching. All normal shell commands like `ls' and `cp' use glob style
  matching and that is what users are used to. Full regular expressions
  are not really needed.


* Approximate (fuzzy) matching.

  I have made in the past a wcd version with full regular expressions and fuzzy
  matching support. My experience was that when the number of directories is
  very large the fuzzy matching often causes unexpected behaviour. That is why
  I removed it again. I used the TRE regexp matching library, made by Ville
  Laurikari. See http://www.laurikari.net/tre/
