TO DO
=====

* Translate the program messages.

  Translation of the messages for wcd is going via the Translation Project (TP).
  See http://translationproject.org/domain/wcd.html


* Translate the manual.

  Translation of the manual for wcd is going via the Translation Project (TP).
  See http://translationproject.org/domain/wcd-man.html


* Improve interface for East Asian double width CJK fonts (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
  in a Windows console. This depends on ncurses development. PDCurses development is
  on hold.

* Support scripts that write from right to left like Arabic, Persian or Hebrew.



I always kept this in mind while developing wcd:
* keep it simple.
  Usable without knowing all the options.
* wcd is a directory changer.
  The main goal is to change directory with a minimal amount of keystrokes.
  Don't change wcd into a directory/file manager.
* low requirements.
  A minimal wcd version can be build with just an ansi-C compiler.
  The graphical tree can be drawn with ascii characters and colours
  are not required. This way wcd runs also on very old systems.
* portable
  So I can use wcd everywhere.
* backwards compatible
  Don't bother users.
  In a multi-user environment, old and new versions can be used together.


NOT TO DO
=========

Things I deliberately not implemented. (This may change in the future.)

* Extended regular expressions support.

  Full regular expressions are too powerful for file and directory name
  matching. All normal shell commands like `ls' and `cp' use glob style
  matching and that is what users are used to. Full regular expressions
  are not really needed.


* Approximate (fuzzy) matching.

  I have made in the past a wcd version with full regular expressions and fuzzy
  matching support. My experience was that when the number of directories is
  very large the fuzzy matching often causes unexpected behaviour. That is why
  I removed it again. I used the TRE regexp matching library, made by Ville
  Laurikari. See http://www.laurikari.net/tre/
