NOTE

	To compile wcd with internationalization support see INSTALL.unix.intl.txt

	Use instructions in this file if instructions in INSTALL.unix.intl.txt fail.


Using GNU tools

	Change to directory `src'.

	If you have GNU make installed on your system first try:

	    make -f old/Makefile.gnu

	This will try to build wcd with (n)curses interface, using gcc
	or cc and ncurses or curses. On some (non-Linux) systems GNU
	make is installed as `gmake' command:

	    gmake -f old/Makefile.gnu

	Installation:

	    make -f old/Makefile.gnu install

	By default the `install' target will install the program in
	/usr/local/bin and the man file in /usr/local/share/man. You
	can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by
	modifying the 'prefix' variable. An Example:

	    make prefix=$HOME clean all install

	To disable curses and compile wcd with plain stdin/stdout
	interface type, reset the CURSES variable:

	    make -f old/Makefile.gnu CURSES=


Alternative simple GNU makefiles


	If the Makefile.gnu failed, the options are after changing to
	directory `src'.

	With gcc compiler and ncurses:
	  make -f old/Makefile.gnu.ncurses

	With gcc compiler and stdin/stdout interface:
	  make -f old/Makefile.gnu.std

	With gcc compiler and PDcurses:
	  make -f old/Makefile.gnu.pdcurses
	
	Note: using PDcurses on Unix makes not much sense for wcd,
	because it runs in its own separate window, not in the
	current terminal.


Using native OS tools

	With HP-UX cc and ncurses:
	  make -f Makefile.HP-UX.ncurses

	With HP-UX cc and curses:
	  make -f Makefile.HP-UX.curses

	With SunOS cc and curses:
	  make -f Makefile.SunOS.curses

	With SunOS gcc and curses:
	  make -f Makefile.SunOS.curses CC=gcc CFLAGS=-Ic3po LFLAGS=-lcurses

	QNX 4.25
	  make4qnx

Using Imake

	Wcd can also be compiled with Imake:

	    xmkmf
	    make depend
	    make
	    make install

	The last command copies wcd.exe to your $HOME/bin directory.
	Note: Imake will overwrite the makefile "Makefile".

PORTABILITY

	See also section "Source code" in file README.txt.

	--

	A compile error occurs when you use gcc < 3.0 and
	<stdbool.h> is included somewhere (e.g. in curses.h).

	Thanks to Kevin M. Rosenberg, apply the following patch:

	    patch -p1 < patch/wcd_bool.diff

	--

	Conflicting curses.h ncurses.h

	On some systems curses.h is conflicting with ncurses.h. To
	compile wcd you can solve this by creating a symbolic link
	curses.h in the wcd source directory pointing to the ncurses.h
	file and adding -I. to CFLAGS in old/Makefile.ncurses.gcc.

	This problem was seen on a BSDI BSD/OS 4.0 system.
	/usr/local/include/ncurses.h

	......................................................................


	Make sure that you have a copy of wcd.exe in a directory
	listed in your PATH environment. If you install a local copy,
	for example in your $HOME/bin directory, this directory must
	be added to the PATH environment.

	Copy file wcd.1 somewhere in $MANPATH .

SHELL Integration

    Installation of wcd function or alias

	Note that the current working directory of a Bourne-like or C
	shell can only be changed by the builtin cd command. Therefore
	the binary is always called by a function or alias. The
	function or alias sources a shell script (go-script) which is
	generated by the binary wcd.exe. Wcd can only work after the
	function or alias is defined.

    Bourne-like shells

	Korn Shell (ksh, pdksh), Bourne Again Shell (bash), Z shell (zsh), ash, ...

	1) Copy wcd along your PATH, we assume your path
	contains $HOME/bin:

	    cp wcd.exe $HOME/bin

	2) Add the following function the Shell's startup file of your
	shell. For instance in: $HOME/.kshrc (ksh), $HOME/.bashrc
	(bash) or $HOME/.zshenv (zsh)

	    function wcd
	    {
	       $HOME/bin/wcd.exe "$@" &&
	       . $HOME/bin/wcd.go
	    }

	Reload modifications to see new function wcd(). E.g. in Bash:

	    . ~/.bashrc

    C Shell (csh/tcsh)

	1) Copy wcd along your PATH, we assume your path
	contains $HOME/bin:

	    cp wcd.exe $HOME/bin

	2) Add the following alias to the Shell's startup file
	$HOME/.cshrc or $HOME/.tcshrc respectively:

	    alias wcd "$HOME/bin/wcd.exe \!* ; source $HOME/bin/wcd.go"

	Log out and log in to make settings active.
