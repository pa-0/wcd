Build and install wcd with internationalization support.

For dos/windows/cygwin see BUILD.dos_windows.intl.txt.

Prerequisites
=============

* gcc       : GNU C compiler
* make      : GNU make
* sh        : Bourne type shell
* coreutils : GNU core utilities package
* gettext   : Framework to help GNU packages produce multi-lingual messages.
* ncurses   : CRT screen handling and optimization package

* man         : Man, apropos en whatis
* groff       : GNU troff text formatting system.
* ghostscript : An interpreter for the PostScript language and for PDF


Basic Installation
==================


Change to directory `src'.


Build wcd:

  Type `make' to compile the package.

Install wcd:

  Type `make install' to install the package.

  `make install' will also compile the package if it wasn't done yet.

To start clean:

  Type `make clean'


UTF-8 Unicode support
=====================

To activate UTF-8 support add WCD_UTF8=1 to the make command:

 `make WCD_UTF8=1'

This requires an (n)curses installation with wide character support.


Installation Names
==================

By default `make install' will install the program in /usr/local/bin, the
language files in /usr/local/share/locale and the man file in
/usr/local/share/man. You can specify an installation prefix other than
`/usr/local' by giving `make' the option `PREFIX=PATH'.


Example:

  make clean
  make install PREFIX=/home/waterlan



tar.gz package
==============

After installation a tar gzip file can be created that contains
a ready-to-run wcd package.

  Type `make tgzpackage' to create the .tar.gz file.


zip package
===========

After installation a zip file can be created that contains
a ready-to-run wcd package.

  Type `make zippackage' to create the .zip file.


Installation of wcd function or alias
=====================================

The current working directory of a Bourne-like or C shell can only be
changed by the builtin cd command. Therefore the binary is always called by a
function or alias. The function or alias sources a shell script (go-script)
which is generated by the binary wcd.exe. Wcd can only work after the function
or alias is defined.


 ===== Bourne-like shells: =====

Korn Shell (ksh, pdksh), Bourne Again Shell (bash), Z shell (zsh), ash, ...


 Add the following function to a startup file of your shell. For instance in:
$HOME/.kshrc (ksh)
$HOME/.bashrc (bash)
$HOME/.zshenv (zsh)

function wcd
{
   PREFIX/bin/wcd.exe $*
   . $HOME/bin/wcd.go
}

Replace PREFIX with the prefix used during package installation.
Start a new shell


 ===== C Shell (csh): =====


 Add the following alias to your $HOME/.cshrc
 file.

alias wcd "PREFIX/bin/wcd.exe \!* ; source $HOME/bin/wcd.go"

Replace PREFIX with the prefix used during package installation.
Start a new C Shell
