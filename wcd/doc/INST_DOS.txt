Basic installation
==================


Unpack the zip file in a directory of your choice which we will call PREFIX.

You will get the following directories:

bin/          Program and run-time libraries.
share/        Documentation and language files.

Add directory 'bin' to your PATH environment variable:

  set PATH=%PATH%;PREFIX\bin

Replace PREFIX with the directory path where you unpacked the zip file.

- DOS 16 bit version:

 Make sure that wcd.exe is in your path.

......................................................................

- DOS 32 bit version:

 Make sure that wcd.exe and cwsdpmi.exe are in your path.

......................................................................

- DOS Bourne Again Shell (bash):


 Add the following function to your ~/_bashrc
 file. Notice that under Windows 95/NT the ~/.bashrc
 file overrides the ~/_bashrc file. In that case place
 the function in ~/.bashrc

function wcd
{
   PREFIX/bin/wcdbash.exe $*
   . ${WCDHOME:-${HOME:-"c:"}}/wcd.go
}

Replace PREFIX with the prefix used during package installation.
Start a new bash

...

If HOME is set, DJGPP bash will read '_bashrc' from %HOME%.
Your wcd function could now look like:

function wcd
{
   PREFIX/bin/wcd.exe $*
   . ${WCDHOME:-${HOME}}/wcd.go
}

If the environment variable WCDHOME is set wcd will use
WCDHOME instead of HOME.

- Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe)

Add the 'bin' folder to PATH.

In Windows Command Prompt a Windows program cannot change the current work
directory, but a .bat file can.

The batch scrip "wcd.bat" runs the wcd program which generates a new batch
script "wcdgo.bat". Then wcd.bat runs wcdgo.bat which actually changes the
directory.

......................................................................
- Windows VISTA/7

In a Windows VISTA/7 Command Prompt you may have limited access to directories.
To get access to more directories you need adminstrator rights. You can get
a Command Prompt with administrator rights if you right click on the Command
Prompt icon and select `Run as administrator'.

......................................................................
- Windows PowerShell

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell

It  is  required that environment variable HOME or WCDHOME is set.  A function
in your PowerShell user profile must be defined. The location of this profile
is stored in the $profile variable.

function wcd
{
  PREFIX\bin\wcdwin32psh.exe $args
  & $env:HOME\wcdgo.ps1
}

Replace PREFIX with the prefix used during package installation.
Start a new PowerShell


......................................................................
- WinZsh (zsh) and MSYS (bash)

A native Windows port of Z shell has been made by Amol Deshpande.
See http://waterlan.home.xs4all.nl/#ZSH
An updated version is available at:
http://zsh-nt.sourceforge.net/

MSYS, a contraction of "Minimal SYStem", is a Bourne Shell command line
interpreter system. Offered as an alternative to Microsoft's cmd.exe, this
provides a general purpose command line environment, which is particularly
suited to use with MinGW, for porting of many Open Source applications to the
MS-Windows platform. See also http://www.mingw.org/



It  is  required that environment variable HOME or WCDHOME is set.  A function
must be defined like this:

function wcd
{
   PREFIX/bin/wcdwin32zsh.exe $*
   . ${WCDHOME:-${HOME}}/wcd.go
}

MSYS bash: put this function e.g. in $HOME/.bashrc
Z Shell  : put this function e.g. in $HOME/.zshenv

Replace PREFIX with the prefix used during package installation.


You have to start MSYS like this: msys.bat --norxvt , because the default rxvt
terminal doesn't accept standard input from native Windows programs. See also
http://www.nabble.com/Accepting-standard-input-from-MSYS-with-native-Win32-programs-td19432889.html
You need a recent version of msys.bat that supports option --norxvt.

......................................................................
- Native MSYS (bash)

The native MSYS version of wcd is linked against the MSYS runtime DLL.
This version uses MSYS style directory paths: E.g. in MSYS the path
"C:\Program Files" maps to "/c/Program Files"

Define a function like this:

function wcd
{
   PREFIX/bin/wcdmsys.exe $*
   . ${WCDHOME:-${HOME}}/bin/wcd.go
}

The native MSYS version behaves exactly as the Unix version of wcd:

o) regards case by default.
   - Use option -i to ignore case.
o) does not use drive letters.
o) Uses the same filenames for treedata files etc.

......................................................................

- UNC support

UNC stands for Universal Naming Convention.
It is a Windows 9x/NT way of accessing network drives without
using a drive letter.
It's from Windows SMB LAN manager networking.
A UNC path looks like: \\servername\sharename

In Windows networking, you can map a drive letter to a UNC:
  net use G: \\gui_fileserv\apps

The Windows Command Prompt version of wcd supports UNC paths since version 3.1.0.
To change to the UNC path wcd makes use of the 'pushd' command in the
wcdgo.bat script.

Quote from John Savill's Windows NT/2000 FAQ (http://www.windows2000faq.com):

"The 'pushd' command automatically maps a drive and navigates to it. If you
run the 'net use' command after you run pushd, you'll see a new drive mapping.
After you're done working in the UNC location, use the 'popd' command to
navigate back to your original network location before you ran 'pushd'."

Options -S, -A and -E can also work on servernames. For instance:

  wcd -S \\servername

will search for shared directories on the server and scan them all.


The Windows PowerShell and MSYS/ZSH version of wcd have full support of UNC paths.
One can change directly to UNC paths, without mapping to a drive letter.

- OS/2 Command Prompt (cmd.exe)

Add the 'bin' folder to PATH.

In OS/2 Command Prompt an OS/2 program cannot change the current work
directory, but a .cmd file can.

The command scrip "wcd.cmd" runs the wcd program which generates a new command
script "wcdgo.cmd". Then wcd.cmd runs wcdgo.cmd which actually changes the
directory.
