WCD

Wherever Change Directory - chdir for DOS and Unix

Description
-----------

Wcd is a command-line program to change directory fast. It saves time typing at
the keyboard. One needs to type only a part of a directory name and wcd will
jump to it. Wcd has a fast selection method in case of multiple matches and
allows aliasing and banning of directories. Wcd also includes a full screen
interactive directory tree browser with speed search.

Wcd was modeled after Norton Change Directory (NCD). NCD appeared first in
The Norton Utilities, Release 4, for DOS in 1987, published by Peter Norton.

Wcd has been ported to different command-line shells: DOS command.com,
Windows cmd.exe and PowerShell, OS/2 cmd.exe, and Unix shells such as Bourne
(sh), Bourne Again (bash), Korn (ksh), Z (zsh), and C (csh) shell and others
running on any operating system.

Wcd supports 8 bit character sets on all systems, and has optional
support for Unicode.
